# Cal's Custom Sign Shop

Welcome to Cal's Custom Sign Shop on Exercism's Swift Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.
If you get stuck on the exercise, check out `HINTS.md`, but try and solve it without using those first :)

## Introduction

Strings are a data type that represent a text value.
[`Strings`][strings-and-characters] in Swift are a collection of `Character`s, which themselves hold a [Unicode scalar values][unicode-scalar-values].

You can create a String through a string literal, which is a series of characters enclosed in double quotation marks (`"`).
For multi-line strings, you can use triple quotation marks (`"""`).

```swift
let hello : String = "Hello, World!"

let poem : String = """
Roses are red,
Violets are blue.
Sugar is sweet,
And so are you.
"""
```

Strings in Swift also obtain all of the functionality of the [NSString][nsstring-docs] class which was originally used in Apple's Objective-C libraries.

## Character

`Character` is a data type that stores a single [Unicode scalar value][unicode-scalar-values] that is made up of one or more Unicode code points.
A Unicode scalar value is any [Unicode code][unicode] point in the range `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` inclusive or `U+E000` to `U+10FFFF` inclusive.

```swift
let aChar : Character = "A"
```

## Type inference

Swift can infer the type of a string literal, and will by default infer it to be a `String`.
You can explicitly declare a string to be a `Character` by using the `Character` type annotation, which requires the value to be a single character.

```swift
let aString = "A"
let aChar: Character = "A"
print(type(of: aString)) // Prints String
print(type(of: aChar))   // Prints Character

// The following code will not compile
let badChar: Character = "Too many characters"
// Error: Cannot convert value of type 'String' to specified type 'Character'
```

## Concatenation

In Swift can strings be [concatenated][] using the `+` operator.
Characters can **not** be concatenated with strings using the `+` operator without first converting the character to a string.

```swift
print("honey" + "comb")
// Prints "honeycomb"
```

The [`append(_:)`][append] method mutates the string by adding either a string or a character to the end of it.

```swift
var greeting = "Hello"
let world = ", world"
let period: Character = "."

greeting.append(world)
print(greeting) // Prints "Hello, world"

greeting.append(period)
print(greeting) // Prints "Hello, world."
```

## String interpolation

[String interpolation][string-interpolation] is a way of constructing a String based on values from different sources like variables and expressions.
To insert a value into a string using string interpolation, you place an expression or value in parentheses which are preceded by a backslash character.

```swift
let radius = 5.0
let circle = "The area of a circle with radius \(radius) is \(Double.pi * radius * radius)"
print(circle) // Prints "The area of a circle with radius 5.0 is 78.53981633974483"
```

## String and Character properties

Strings and characters have a few different _properties_ which can be queried to get information about the string or character.

### String properties

Here are some of the most common string properties, but to find all, see the [documentation][string-docs].

| Property  | Description                                    | Example                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `isEmpty` | Returns `true` if the string is empty          | `"Hello".isEmpty equals false` |
| `count`   | Returns the number of characters in the string | `"Hello".count   equals 5`     |

### Character properties

Here are some of the most common character properties, but to find all, see the [documentation][string-docs].

| Property       | Description                                   | Example                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `isLowercase`  | Returns `true` if the character is lowercase  | `"a".isLowercase  equals true` |
| `isUppercase`  | Returns `true` if the character is uppercase  | `"A".isUppercase  equals true` |
| `isNumber`     | Returns `true` if the character is a number   | `"1".isNumber     equals true` |
| `isWhitespace` | Returns `true` if the character is whitespace | `" ".isWhitespace equals true` |

## Type conversion

To convert a type to a string, you can use the `String()` initializer, which accepts a variety of types, including `Int`, `Double`, `Character`, and more.

```swift
let charX: Character = "x"
print(String(charX))     // Prints "x"
print(String(110))       // Prints "110"
print(String(Double.pi)) // Prints "3.141592653589793"
```

## Special characters

Swift has a few [special characters][special-characters] that can be used in strings.

| Value    | Description                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `\0`     | Null character                |
| `\\`     | Backslash                     |
| `\t`     | Horizontal tab                |
| `\n`     | Line feed                     |
| `\r`     | Carriage return               |
| `\'`     | Single quote mark             |
| `\"`     | Double quote mark             |
| `\uFFFF` | Hexadecimal unicode character |

```swift
let quote : String = "\"Hello\", he said."
print(quote) // Prints "Hello", he said.

let unicode : Character = "\u{1F496}"
print(unicode) // Prints ðŸ’–
```

## Instructions

In this exercise you'll be writing code to help a sign company create custom messages for their signs.

## 1. Create a set of useful strings

Define the following constant strings which will be used to create signs:

- `birthday`: This holds the value "Birthday"
- `valentine`: This holds the value "Valentine's Day"
- `anniversary`: This holds the string "Anniversary"

## 2. Create a set of useful characters

Define the following constant characters which will be used to create signs:

- `space`: This holds the value " " (a single space)
- `exclamation`: This holds the value "!"

## 3. Combine phrases to build up messages

Implement the function `buildSign(for:name:)`, which takes the argument `for` which holds one of the three strings you defined in the first task and the argument `name` which is a string that holds the name of the person the sign is for.
You shall use concatenation to build up the message for the sign and remember to reuse the already defined constants.
The function should return the sign message as a string.

```swift
buildSign(for: birthday, name: "Otto")
// returns "Happy Birthday Otto!"

buildSign(for: anniversary, name: "Valentina")
// returns "Happy Anniversary Valentina!"
```

## 4. Build a graduation sign

Implement the function `graduationFor(name:year:)` which takes the argument `name` which is a string that holds the name of the person the sign is for and the argument `year` which is an integer that holds the year the person is graduating.
You shall use template strings to build up the message for the sign.
The function should return the sign message as a string.

```swift
graduationFor(name: "Padma", year: 2023)
// returns "Congratulations Padma!\nClass of 2023"
```

## 5. Compute the cost of a sign

Implement the function `costOf(sign:)` which takes the argument `sign` which is a string that holds the message for the sign.
The sign has a base price of 20 in the given currency. Additionally each letter costs 2 (Whitespaces are included in the calculation).
The function should return the cost of the sign as an integer.

```swift
costOf(sign: "Happy Birthday Grandma!")
// returns 66
```
